Hello! 

I am a psychology and sociology graduate who decided to transition to software/ web development when it came time to seriously consider and commit to a career path, especially due to how prevalent technology is across just about every industry.

Leveraging my educational background in a primarily non-IT field, I strive to combine my knowledge of other disciplines alongside software development in order to understand how a piece of software relates to and drives other aspects of an organisation, such as consumer psychology and commerce.

Currently as of January 2022, I am taking part in a 10 week micro-internship as part of Mission Ready’s tech career accelerator programme (https://www.missionreadyhq.com/), after having gone through the full stack development and advanced software courses between May and December of 2021. 

In my profile are 3 repositories at the moment, which showcase the completed projects I worked on during the aforementioned studies through Mission Ready as well as my own supplemental work through online self-education.

The technologies and programming languages I am learning and using at the moment are: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (React JS, Express/ Node JS), Dart (Flutter), Database platforms SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL) and MongoDB, as well as cloud platforms and API'S such as IBM/AWS/Azure.
